[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06516)/[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68d5d4W_XB4)                                                     **IROS 2025 Under Review**  

Although flapping‑wing aerial vehicles have achieved considerable progress by emulating birds, insects, and other flyers—often incorporating compliant thoracic structures for energy‑efficient wing actuation—butterfly‑inspired robots remain uncommon and typically ignore the natural role of abdominal movement in flight stabilization, instead relying on rigid linkages that increase complexity and weight. This paper therefore presents a biomimetic robotic butterfly (BRB) integrating a novel compliant mechanism to achieve coupled wing‑abdomen motion, develops a dynamic model to analyze how abdominal undulation affects flapping patterns and average lift, and validates these findings through motion‑capture experiments on three configurations (no abdomen, fixed abdomen, undulating abdomen), demonstrating that undulation increases lift generation by 3.4%, extends flight duration, enhances forward distance, and stabilizes pitch oscillations, thereby highlighting the critical importance of wing‑abdomen interaction for improved flight performance in FWAVs.

Current research on attitude and state estimation for flapping‑wing aerial vehicles has largely relied on conventional filters—such as Extended Kalman Filters, Mahony complementary filters, and Madgwick filters—that either suffer degraded performance under the high‑frequency vibrations induced by wing flapping or mitigate these oscillations through cycle‑averaging methods that introduce unacceptable delays for agile maneuvers. This paper therefore presents a novel learning‑based framework for online state estimation in avian‑inspired FWAVs: it first extracts and removes flapping‑induced oscillations from low‑cost MARG sensor data via periodic Gaussian process regression augmented with real‑time FFT and cross‑correlation for accurate phase alignment and sphere k‑means clustering for phase‑based smoothing; it then feeds the resulting oscillation‑free signals into an Extended Kalman Filter together with an internal, cycle‑averaged aerodynamic model derived from Newton–Euler equations to yield accurate, low‑latency attitude and translational estimates; real‑flight experiments under windy conditions demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms conventional filters by preserving critical transient dynamics and enabling agile, autonomous flapping‑wing flight in complex environments.
