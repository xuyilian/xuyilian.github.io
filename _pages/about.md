I am a junior at the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Zhejiang University. I started my research work in 2023 and have a strong interest in **flapping-wing vehicles** and **soft robotics**. My research focuses on areas such as **flexible structure optimization**, **multi-modal locomotion**, and **neuro-inspired perception and motion algorithm development**. I am honored to be guided by [Professor Tiefeng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-TW&user=vpaskyAAAAAJ) and [Dr. Chen Qian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-TW&user=KWktyPcefrIC). Below are some of the research and course projects I have led or participated in. If you are interested or have any questions about any of these topics, please feel free to contact me. I am also looking for more research opportunities in related fields for my future graduate studies.

  <strong>Abdominal Undulation with Compliant Mechanism Improves Flight Performance of Biomimetic Robotic Butterfly</strong>

[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06516)/[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68d5d4W_XB4)                                                     **IROS 2025 Under Review**  

Although flapping‑wing aerial vehicles have achieved considerable progress by emulating birds, insects, and other flyers—often incorporating compliant thoracic structures for energy‑efficient wing actuation—butterfly‑inspired robots remain uncommon and typically ignore the natural role of abdominal movement in flight stabilization, instead relying on rigid linkages that increase complexity and weight. This paper therefore presents a biomimetic robotic butterfly (BRB) integrating a novel compliant mechanism to achieve coupled wing‑abdomen motion, develops a dynamic model to analyze how abdominal undulation affects flapping patterns and average lift, and validates these findings through motion‑capture experiments on three configurations (no abdomen, fixed abdomen, undulating abdomen), demonstrating that undulation increases lift generation by 3.4%, extends flight duration, enhances forward distance, and stabilizes pitch oscillations, thereby highlighting the critical importance of wing‑abdomen interaction for improved flight performance in FWAVs.

**IEEE Transaction on Industrial Electronics Under Review**  

Current research on attitude and state estimation for flapping‑wing aerial vehicles has largely relied on conventional filters—such as Extended Kalman Filters, Mahony complementary filters, and Madgwick filters—that either suffer degraded performance under the high‑frequency vibrations induced by wing flapping or mitigate these oscillations through cycle‑averaging methods that introduce unacceptable delays for agile maneuvers. This paper therefore presents a novel learning‑based framework for online state estimation in avian‑inspired FWAVs: it first extracts and removes flapping‑induced oscillations from low‑cost MARG sensor data via periodic Gaussian process regression augmented with real‑time FFT and cross‑correlation for accurate phase alignment and sphere k‑means clustering for phase‑based smoothing; it then feeds the resulting oscillation‑free signals into an Extended Kalman Filter together with an internal, cycle‑averaged aerodynamic model derived from Newton–Euler equations to yield accurate, low‑latency attitude and translational estimates; real‑flight experiments under windy conditions demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms conventional filters by preserving critical transient dynamics and enabling agile, autonomous flapping‑wing flight in complex environments.
